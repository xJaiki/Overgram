# Overgram

Overgram is a desktop application built as a learning tool for Electron. It creates a small button on the right side of the screen that, when clicked, displays a web Telegram overlay on top of all windows.
With Overgram, you can have the convenience of using Telegram without having to constantly switch between windows. The overlay feature allows you to stay productive while still being able to chat with your friends and family.
